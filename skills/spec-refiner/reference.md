# Spec Refiner Reference

## Type Classification

Classify the user's idea into one of these types based on signals in their description. When ambiguous, ask the user.

| Type | Signals | Examples |
|------|---------|----------|
| **software** | "build", "system", "service", "API", "database", "deploy", "architecture", "backend", "frontend", "microservice", "pipeline" | REST API, data pipeline, CLI tool, web app, infrastructure |
| **product** | "feature", "user", "launch", "experience", "workflow", "onboarding", "conversion", "engagement", "customer" | New product feature, redesign, mobile app, user-facing workflow |
| **scientific** | "hypothesis", "experiment", "measure", "analyze", "effect", "correlation", "sample", "statistical", "A/B test", "causal" | A/B test design, causal analysis, metric investigation, research study |
| **agentic** | "agent", "skill", "prompt", "subagent", "tool", "autonomous", "orchestrator", "LLM", "AI system" | Cursor skill, agent workflow, LLM-powered tool, multi-agent system |
| **general** | None of the above, or a mix that doesn't fit a specific type | Process design, policy, governance framework, training curriculum |

**Hybrid specs**: When the idea spans multiple types (e.g., "build a product feature that requires an A/B test to validate"), use the primary type for the template skeleton and merge in dimensions from secondary types. Note the hybrid nature in the spec metadata.

## Probing Dimensions

Each dimension below includes:
- **What to probe**: The core concern
- **Skeptical angles**: How to challenge the spec in this dimension
- **Seed questions**: Starting questions the questioner adapts to the specific spec

### Universal Dimensions (all types)

#### Scope & Goals
**What to probe**: Clarity of boundaries, measurability of success, presence of non-goals.

**Skeptical angles**:
- Are the goals actually measurable or just aspirational?
- Is the scope creeping beyond what's stated?
- Are there implicit goals hiding behind the explicit ones?
- Are the non-goals truly out of scope, or are they things the author hopes someone else will handle?

**Seed questions**:
- What would a minimal version of this look like that still achieves the core goal?
- What happens if you achieve all the stated goals but users/stakeholders are still unhappy — what's missing?
- Which goals could conflict with each other? How do you prioritize when they do?
- What are you tempted to include that you should explicitly exclude?

#### Assumptions & Constraints
**What to probe**: Hidden assumptions, unstated constraints, things taken for granted.

**Skeptical angles**:
- What would break if any of these assumptions turned out to be false?
- Are constraints real (physics, regulation) or self-imposed (convention, preference)?
- Which assumptions have been validated vs. just believed?

**Seed questions**:
- What are you assuming about the environment, users, data, or infrastructure that might not hold?
- Which of your constraints are truly immovable vs. negotiable with the right effort?
- If you had to defend every assumption to a skeptic, which ones would be hardest to justify?
- What has changed recently that might invalidate a previously safe assumption?

#### Dependencies & Prerequisites
**What to probe**: External dependencies, sequencing, blocking conditions.

**Skeptical angles**:
- What happens if a dependency is delayed, changed, or removed?
- Are there circular dependencies hiding in the plan?
- Is something being assumed as "already done" that actually isn't?

**Seed questions**:
- What must be true/complete/available before this work can begin?
- What other teams, systems, or processes does this depend on? Have they committed?
- What is the critical path? What happens if the longest-lead dependency slips?
- Are there dependencies you haven't listed because they feel obvious?

#### Risks & Failure Modes
**What to probe**: What can go wrong, probability and impact, mitigation plans.

**Skeptical angles**:
- Are the listed risks the real risks, or the comfortable-to-list ones?
- Are mitigations concrete and actionable, or hand-wavy?
- What's the worst-case scenario nobody wants to talk about?

**Seed questions**:
- What is the single most likely way this fails? What about the most catastrophic?
- For each risk, what is the early warning signal? How would you detect it?
- What happens if this succeeds in ways you didn't expect? (Positive risks / scaling challenges)
- Is there a risk you've been avoiding thinking about?

#### Stakeholders & Audience
**What to probe**: Who cares, who decides, who executes, who is affected.

**Skeptical angles**:
- Is anyone affected who hasn't been consulted?
- Are the people who must execute this the same ones who designed it?
- Could stakeholder interests conflict?

**Seed questions**:
- Who has veto power over this? Whose buy-in is required?
- Who will build/execute this? Do they have the skills and capacity?
- Who will be affected but has no voice in this spec? Should they?
- If this goes wrong, who bears the consequences?
